# Meal Prep Dojo

Original application for those who are looking for a way to stay on point with their diet.

With MPD you can create your meals by picking and choosing ingredients from FatSecret's official collection. With realiable nutritional information for each of your meals, you can then distribute them along the week/month with an easy to use drag-and-drop functionality. Each day will have information about total macronutrients. By selecting days you can go the groceries store, you can print out a list with the ingredients you need to accomplish you desired meal plan.

# Technologies

Firebase for database, authentication and cloud functions.

React.Js and Redux for state driven front-end code.

Express.js as my back-end framework. I need to have a server to bypass CORS restriction and use FatSecret's API. Otherwise, I would go with serverless for this application.
